      <description>Stop struggling with Microsoft Word I recently had to collaborate on a project which involved writing a boring report with Microsoft Word. The experience made me realize&amp;mdash;or rather reminded me how little most people know how to use it. I thought I&amp;rsquo;d share with you a few tips to make you much more efficient with Microsoft Word.
This article was written using Microsoft Word for Office 365 MSO (16.0.11629.20192) 32-bit. UI changes in further updates may not be accurately reflected.</description>

      <description>What is Pride Pride doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean considering yourself superior to others. It means not looking down, not feeling ashamed for who you are. It means keeping our head up in the face of adversity.
Pride is an event meant to honor those who fought for our rights and those who still do, those who suffer or even die because of discrimination. It&amp;rsquo;s an event meant to remind the world that discrimination still exists and that we need to fight against it.</description>

      <description>Different games A common question I get when I say I love video games is what kind of games do you play? and I never know what to answer. I am an experimentalist, my pleasure comes from discovering new things. I love playing games that surprise me. So for a first article on this blog I thought I would share with you some games that are quite unique and different. Games of all genres and on various platforms.</description>
