    <h1 id="the-wrong-song"><a href="#the-wrong-song">The Wrong Song</a></h1>
<p>A light summer blouse, a skirt below the thighs
A pair of glasses and bright brown eyes
An innocent air and a little girl&rsquo;s drive
If some looks can kill, hers can revive</p>
<p>A pair of checkered shoes and a shirt with plaid
An unkempt beard that makes him look rad
Irises of blues that haven&rsquo;t played in a while
His tired little grin has just a hint of guile</p>
<p>And yet&hellip;</p>
<p>People always try to keep appearances
Better tell a lie than offend the masses
They would rather die under false pretenses
Time to say goodbye to this innocence</p>
<p>He might look tough but he&rsquo;s only sixteen
Because of his beard he never gets ID&rsquo;d
There is not a thing innocent about her
He&rsquo;s the prey and she&rsquo;s the predator</p>
<p>She likes it doggy and tonight they&rsquo;ll fuck
Him tied up and the lady on top
And although neighbors will be woken by the whimpers
They&rsquo;ll be too busy to call the cops</p>
<p>Why do you have to screw up every song
They say, yet they sing along
Everything you write is wrong
They say, yet they sing along
Why do you have to screw up every song
They say, yet they sing along
Everything you write is wrong
They say, yet they sing along</p>
<p>She gets uneasy when she receives a compliment
She averts her eyes to hide her embarrassment
Dirty jokes she never seems to understand
Or out of shyness perhaps she ignores them</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s worried about being different
So afraid of being found perverted
That she&rsquo;ll spend her life of harmless sin
Hurting herself pretendin'</p>
<p>All that because&hellip;</p>
<p>People always try to keep appearances
Better tell a lie than offend the masses
They would rather die under false pretenses
Time to say goodbye to this innocence</p>
<p>People get angry when they should be getting blushes
Getting mad at me must be one of their fetishes
You are not worthy of your pure and precious image
If you&rsquo;re so PC you won&rsquo;t like the next passage</p>
<p>She resells her used underwear at high cost
To people turned on by her little girl musk
With the cash she&rsquo;ll buy herself dildos and cuffs
And a couple bottles to help swallow the loss</p>
<p>Of the family and friends she&rsquo;d hug
Were it not for the trench they have dug
When they tried to beat her into love
Like&rsquo;s she&rsquo;s some kind of a dirty rug</p>
<p>Yet they drag her to church and force her to pray
To a god who won&rsquo;t let her live in her own way
And now we should just smile and stare in silence
Because obviously we provoke intolerance?!</p>
<p>Fuck off!</p>
<p>Why do you have to screw up every song
They say, yet they sing along
Everything you write is wrong
They say, yet they sing along
I don&rsquo;t try to screw up every song
I say, I just play along
Everything around is wrong
I&rsquo;m tired, so I sing along</p>

<p>Noticing a lot of my songs were more bitter than bittersweet, I decided to take inspiration from Aurelio Voltaire, who writes humorous songs about horrible things. There are obvious nods to <cite>Death Death (Devil, Devil, Evil, Evil, Song)</cite> in this composition, both in the themes and structure. The bit where the narrator looses their cool is also a nod to Voltaire&rsquo;s <cite>Oh Lord (Wake the Dead)</cite>, which ends in an improvised rant about God. But in the end, I guess this still isn&rsquo;t a happy song. Ooops!</p>
<p>The first three lines are a reference to my previous song <a href="/poems/the-beast-in-a-domino/">The Beast in a Domino</a> which told a similar story from a different perspective. I hope the bold sexual themes of this song aren&rsquo;t too much for my free hosting service or the eyes of my readers.</p>
