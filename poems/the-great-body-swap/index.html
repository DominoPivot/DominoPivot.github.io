    <h1 id="the-great-body-swap">The Great Body-Swap</h1>
<p>Today all at the same time and all over the world
Everyone took a nap &lsquo;cause we were all really tired
And when we all woke up we all felt a little bit strange
For somehow in our sleep all of our bodies were exchanged</p>
<p>Some say this is an act of God, the heretic approves
&lsquo;Cause the judgmental priest woke up wearing Arabic shoes
The neo-nazi&rsquo;s mouth is foaming, he sounds so insane
Claiming under his now black skin there&rsquo;s white blood in his veins</p>
<p>Perhaps I should feel sorry, still I find it kinda funny&hellip;</p>
<p>The queers think it&rsquo;s all the same while the cishets are amused
The homophobe&rsquo;s ashamed &lsquo;cause his lover&rsquo;s now a dude
In the eye of the tempest you&rsquo;ll recognize my smile
I don&rsquo;t recall feeling like myself this much in a while</p>
<p>I know I shouldn&rsquo;t make fun of their confusion
But where they see a problem I have found a solution
It&rsquo;s like the world finally makes sense
Now that we all woke up as someone else</p>
<p>Since the great body swap life has been much better
Except I get turned on when I look in a mirror
I&rsquo;ve no more hair on my face but some fat in the right place
And people on the streets no longer care about my race</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve acquired a voice to sing all of my songs
And I&rsquo;ve met plenty more people happy to sing along
To understand each other we just needed to blend
When everyone looks like a stranger, everyone&rsquo;s a friend</p>
<p>Perhaps it makes me petty, still I find it kinda funny&hellip;</p>
<p>That the now tall people won&rsquo;t get typecast in their roles
While their former bodies were left to internet trolls
As for my ex who told everyone about my small dick
Now the bitch is stuck with it, ain&rsquo;t that poetic justice</p>
<p>I know I shouldn&rsquo;t make fun of their confusion
But where they see a problem I have found a solution
It&rsquo;s like the world finally makes sense
Now that we all woke up as someone else</p>

<p>I wrote a funny, happy song for once! The only message you should take from it that we should all be more accepting and welcoming of difference. Sorry if my language was too colorful for you.</p>
