    <h1 id="artifice-english-version">Artifice (English version)</h1>
<p>All that defiles on your TV is just a scene
You fantasize on CGI and on greenscreen
Your concubines have a whole life behind their cups
Bet you wouldn&rsquo;t recognize them without makeup</p>
<p>No hair around the cunt just shave your whole body
Not fat, not flat, no muscles, none of that&rsquo;s girly
Or don&rsquo;t you dare complain if you look plain ugly
Couldn&rsquo;t a lady have moment of mercy</p>
<p>So no one tell me it isn&rsquo;t natural
So no one tell me it&rsquo;s a sin
So no one tell me it ain&rsquo;t natura~l
When your lives are artificial</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t it great, our world
We&rsquo;re certainly what God wanted us to become
Isn&rsquo;t it great, our wo~rld
The age of heresy is long gone</p>
<p>All movies made these days are sexual
And all advertisements superficial
All the games of our youth are virtual
We rely on media to be social</p>
<p>To have or not to have, we want it all
Singular has taken over plural
Engagement is only conditional
Sensual often not consensual</p>
<p>So no one tell me it isn&rsquo;t natural
So no one tell me it&rsquo;s a sin
So no one tell me it ain&rsquo;t natura~l
When your lives are artificial</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t it great, our world
We&rsquo;re certainly what God wanted us to become
Isn&rsquo;t it great, our wo~rld
The age of heresy is long gone</p>
<p>The plane, Walt Disney World, roller coasters with Donald Duck
The sand making the beach that has been dumped there by a truck
The RV or the tent, the smores, the beer in plastic cups
None of it&rsquo;s natural - I don&rsquo;t see you giving a fuck</p>
<p>Clothing, cars, shoes, perfume, trash bags, money
TV, couch, news, music, cartoons, hockey
The table where you eat, the wine and the candles
Your daily luxuries aren&rsquo;t in any way natural</p>
<p>Fruit juice from concentrate or fruit cocktail?
The purity percentage forgotten
Of salt and MSG I&rsquo;ve got my share
As long as it&rsquo;s savoury nobody cares</p>
<p>So no one tell me it isn&rsquo;t natural
So no one tell me it&rsquo;s a sin
So no one tell me it ain&rsquo;t natura~l
When your lives are artificial</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t it great, our world
Don&rsquo;t tell me that this is what God planned for us all
Isn&rsquo;t it great, our wo~rld
Materialist, fake and superficial</p>
<p>So no one tell me it isn&rsquo;t natural
To be bisexual or to be gay
Oh no one tell me it ain&rsquo;t natura~l
That being NB ain&rsquo;t okay
No don&rsquo;t tell me, don&rsquo;t tell me!
That it&rsquo;s something wrong brought by society
That&rsquo;s something&rsquo;s not natural with me
When nothing in your life will ever be</p>

<p>I originally wrote this song in French, but thought I&rsquo;d try the exercice of translating it. While some lines were changed and carry a slightly different meaning, the overall message of the song is the same. You can read the original by clicking on the <em>Fran√ßais</em> link in the navbar.</p>
<p>I have been working on a few songs with similar themes lately, and I thought it would be a good idea to publish this one first since I wrote it a long time ago and never shared this version.</p>
