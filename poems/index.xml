  Adam Neely and Ben Levin&amp;rsquo;s video about interpreting emoji as music inspired me to write a poem entirely in emoji. I won&amp;rsquo;t explain the meaning of this piece as it would pretty much defeat its purpose, but I am considering making an instrumental track for it like Neely and Levin did.</description>

      <title>Artifice (English version)</title>

      <description>Artifice (English version) All that defiles on your TV is just a scene You fantasize on CGI and on greenscreen Your concubines have a whole life behind their cups Bet you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t recognize them without makeup
No hair around the cunt just shave your whole body Not fat, not flat, no muscles, none of that&amp;rsquo;s girly Or don&amp;rsquo;t you dare complain if you look plain ugly Couldn&amp;rsquo;t a lady have moment of mercy</description>

      <title>Broken Chains</title>

      <description>Broken Chains This is a complaint for all things long gone And things that prevailed but have since gone all wrong This is a complaint for memories replaced With a fresh coat of paint that looks out of place
This is a prayer for good things to last And for a future as good as the past This is a prayer for getting better May this pile of mistakes help us climb much higher</description>

      <title>Lies</title>

      <description>Lies While a lie might grow awhile until it fools a whole people Chasing the truth like fools can be the root of great evil
How many wrongs are done in the name of good and god? Even the fruits of sin can fund a worthy cause And a tissue of lies cause one to fall in love
Love is an addiction that&amp;rsquo;s hard to get rid of
To fend off of an oppressor you fight fire with fire While fire can consume so can it warm the bed you lie in</description>

      <description>Bittersweet When I&amp;rsquo;m bored as can be I buy sugar Low on energy I grab sugar When I get moody I eat sugar When I am lonely Spin spin sugar
When I feel salty I groan sugar When I&amp;rsquo;m unhappy I spout sugar When I am angry I spill sugar When life gets to me I cry sugar
When I can&amp;rsquo;t take it I hang on to what I know Sweet escapism</description>

      <description>The Beast in a Domino Her school uniform A fake cover on a book A book she can&amp;rsquo;t show
The edge of her skirt Ultimate territory A convenient breeze
Her guilt-ridden smile A hint of her desires Her frilly panties
I can see under the disguise Masquerading your true essence I read between the lines of lies Your white white lies of innocence
When you&amp;rsquo;re alone the domino falls When no one else is watching you When you lay bare and topple the walls And no one is there to see you go bestial</description>

      <description>Colateral Quench my thirst, soothe this curse with just a slurp or two Let us venture together, surrender all virtue My savior is your flavor and we&amp;rsquo;re long overdue I wanna drown myself deep down a sea of you
Sweeter than any liquor our love is a perfect brew Popping bubbles in the skull on every rendez-vous Passion is just an addiction that we follow through I lust for tasting your perfection and blending with you</description>

      <description>Chocolate and Vanilla Some time ago when you were young, an ice cream shop opened up. Even if you weren’t hungry, you followed your friends to the shop. But when the man at the counter asked you to pick a flavor, you said no thanks, I’ve just had dinner.
Some time ago when you were young, this ice cream shop opened up. Some of your friends were crazy for chocolate, so you hanged around there a lot.</description>
