    <h1 id="broken-chains">Broken Chains</h1>
<p>This is a complaint for all things long gone
And things that prevailed but have since gone all wrong
This is a complaint for memories replaced
With a fresh coat of paint that looks out of place</p>
<p>This is a prayer for good things to last
And for a future as good as the past
This is a prayer for getting better
May this pile of mistakes help us climb much higher</p>
<p>Phrases go blurry as one turns a page
Souvenirs become bagage
What befalls nobodies once we&rsquo;ve fallen
We&rsquo;ll be forgotten
We&rsquo;ll be forgotten</p>
<p>The memories have broken from their chains
Links fall like dominos &lsquo;till nothing remains
But the promises we&rsquo;ve exchanged
And the feeling that I&rsquo;m leaving something important
To oblivion~</p>
<p>This a promise for making things right
I&rsquo;m not one to give up without a fight
This is a promise for a hopeless rescue
I&rsquo;ll risk losing myself for a chance to keep you</p>
<p>Every step I take has a terrible cost
With each story claimed another is lost
I remember your pictures more than your face
I can&rsquo;t recall your voice from lines you have traced</p>
<p>Phrases go blurry as one turns a page
Souvenirs become bagage
What befalls nobodies once we&rsquo;ve fallen
We&rsquo;ll be forgotten
We&rsquo;ll be forgotten</p>
<p>The memories have broken from their chains
Links fall like dominos &lsquo;till nothing remains
But the promises we&rsquo;ve exchanged
And the feeling that I&rsquo;m leaving something important
To oblivion~</p>
<p>We are pips in a castle of cards
Or the seashells on a beach
The tide has come for the forsaken
I&rsquo;ll be forgotten
I&rsquo;ll be forgotten</p>
<p>[While the chorus plays]
Am I swimming? Am I falling down? Which way is up? I&rsquo;m gonna drown
Am I swimming? Am I falling down? Which way is up? I&rsquo;m gonna drown
Am I swimming? Am I falling down? Which way is up? I&rsquo;m gonna drown
Am I swimming? Am I falling down? Which way is up? I&rsquo;m gonna drown</p>
<p>The memories have broken from their chains
Links fall like dominos &lsquo;till nothing remains
But the promises we&rsquo;ve exchanged
And the feeling that this has been something important</p>
<p>And finally my ankles feel light
My heart unshackled the horizon looks bright</p>

<p>I wrote this song after falling in love with Chris Robley&rsquo;s <cite>Irretrievable Beauty</cite> and <a href="https://youtu.be/c8Cj_qieIdw">it&rsquo;s lyrics video</a>. I let his theme of forever lost things inspire me to write my own song, though the comparison ends there.</p>
<p>It only made sense to make tons of references to Kingdom Hearts in that song, a series of games that is entirely fueled by nostalgia. With this song, I&rsquo;m saying a final goodbye to this series which keeps disappointing me. I&rsquo;m not saying I&rsquo;ll stop playing these games, but I need to stop obsessing over what they&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been nostalgic for quite some time, probably because I feel like I used to be much happier than I am right now. Watching the same movies, playing the same old games and reminiscing on old friendships, I&rsquo;ve slowly forgotten to live. I fear that everyone has moved on without me. I feel like <em>here</em> is no longer where I should be. So I need to look for the place where I belong.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure you&rsquo;ll understand everything this song means, but I&rsquo;m proud of it.</p>
