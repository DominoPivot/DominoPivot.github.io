    <h1 id="the-beast-in-a-domino">The Beast in a Domino</h1>
<p>Her school uniform
A fake cover on a book
A book she can&rsquo;t show</p>
<p>The edge of her skirt
Ultimate territory
A convenient breeze</p>
<p>Her guilt-ridden smile
A hint of her desires
Her frilly panties</p>
<p>I can see under the disguise
Masquerading your true essence
I read between the lines of lies
Your white white lies of innocence</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re alone the domino falls
When no one else is watching you
When you lay bare and topple the walls
And no one is there to see you go bestial</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s nothing criminal
To think about things immoral
Submitting or being forceful
And doing the unthinkable
There&rsquo;s not a wrong at all
Dreams need not be consensual
There&rsquo;s pleasure in the plentiful
Desires inadmissible
It&rsquo;s nothing abnormal
To crave for the unusual
Exotically beautiful
Sexually questionable
It&rsquo;s not irrational
To ponder the unethical
Venture into the distasteful
No need to be impeccable
It&rsquo;s only natural
The human is an animal
Don&rsquo;t blame yourself or feel shameful
These urges are forgivable
Drop the conventional
Abandon yourself to carnal
Fantasies of the fanciful
Pleasures unimaginable
Let the domino fall
When you lay bare behind the walls
And no one is there to see you go bestial</p>
<p>Slowly the sun sets
In the corner of her eye
The glint of madness</p>
<p>He searches in vain
In the house where she was raised
With no room to stay</p>
<p>Inhibitions gone
In the night she tracks her prey
When all cats are grey</p>
<p>The moonlight embraces your curves
It dyes your hair a new color
Your fangs and claws grow as you turn
Into the one that hides under</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re alone the domino falls
When no one else is watching you
When you lay bare and topple the walls
And no one is there to see you go bestial</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve all got something grim
An offense without a victim
Some kind of kink that makes us grin
Others would consider a sin
We&rsquo;ve all done something bad
That wouldn&rsquo;t make our parents glad
Got some regrets driving us mad
But it&rsquo;s no reason to feel sad
We&rsquo;re all a little sick
And twisted when we cherry-pick
Like Trekkie said to Monster chick
Just grab your dick and double-click
No one will will judge you here
Be you straight or a little queer
No one will force you to adhere
To drink the Kool-Aid or the beer
Freedom of taste is my lobby
No kink shame in our country
As there is harm in harmony
Unless it&rsquo;s what makes you horny
Don&rsquo;t be afraid to leave the shade
Drop the masquerade and we&rsquo;ll trade
These feathers were made to parade
We&rsquo;ll get you sensually displayed
Let the domino fall
Unveil your flesh in front of all
And let us enjoy seeing you go bestial</p>
<p>She knows what she knows
Yet she keeps on pretending
Her own innocence</p>
<p>Her pounding secrets
Stacks and stacks of books to hide
Of books she can&rsquo;t share</p>
<p>Her cries to the moon
The sounds of lingering pain
A burning passion</p>
<p>This self-inflicted guilt anchor
All the weight that makes you suffer
What do you keep under cover
What would they give to peek under</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re alone the domino falls
When no one else is watching you
When you lay bare and topple the walls
And no one is there to see you go bestial</p>
<p><span class="screaming">BEA-STI-AL!</span>
<span class="screaming">Yatara ama sugiru chokorƒìto mitai na</span>
<span class="screaming">Masshirona yoru wa uso-darake otogibanashi no sekai</span>
A pure white night is a fairy tale world full of <span class="screaming">LIES</span>
To live a life of pretension <span class="screaming">I WOULD RATHER DIE</span>
In the darkness, moments, secrets, regrets never <span class="screaming">LIE</span>
I&rsquo;m the one you have repressed, the animal inside</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re alone, the domino falls
<span class="screaming">And as always I&rsquo;m watching you</span>
Lying bare behind the walls
<span class="screaming">And as always I&rsquo;m watching you</span>
You lick your fangs feeling enthralled
<span class="screaming">And as always I&rsquo;m watching you</span>
In the night you go bestial
And as always I&rsquo;m watching you fap</p>

<p>This is a polished version of a song I first posted on DeviantArt a year ago. It is about a girl who believes her sexual thoughts make her a bad person. Being viewed by everyone as a perfect innocent girl makes her feel like even more of a fraud. A domino is a carnival mask, hence the line <q>When you&rsquo;re alone the domino falls</q>. The girl feels like she&rsquo;s wearing a mask in public and that her true self is the monster she turns into when she&rsquo;s alone.</p>
<p>Fans of Nisioisin and the Monogatari Series will recognize nods to the character Tsubasa Hanekawa. The girl in that story actually represses a lot of her feelings, not just sexual thoughts, to the point where her split personalities turn into actual monsters. You can find many references to Bakemonogatari and Nekomonogatari in this piece, including lines taken from some songs in the anime:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yatara ama sugiru chokoreto mitai na (This chocolate seems too sweet)<br>
Masshirona yoru wa uso-darake otogibanashi no sekai (A pure white night is a fairy tale world full of lies)<br>
In the darkness, moments, secrets, regrets never lie</p>
</blockquote>
