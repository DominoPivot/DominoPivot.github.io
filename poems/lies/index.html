    <h1 id="lies"><a href="#lies">Lies</a></h1>
<p>While a lie might grow awhile until it fools a whole people
Chasing the truth like fools can be the root of great evil</p>
<p>How many wrongs are done in the name of good and god?
Even the fruits of sin can fund a worthy cause
And a tissue of lies cause one to fall in love</p>
<p>Love is an addiction that&rsquo;s hard to get rid of</p>
<p>To fend off of an oppressor you fight fire with fire
While fire can consume so can it warm the bed you lie in</p>
<p>Winter&rsquo;s cold is sickening but so are spring&rsquo;s dandelions</p>
<p>Without its thorns to make it prickly would a rose be quite as pretty?</p>
<p>Beauty is such a fragile thing, a superficial fling
But would you rather trust a harpy or a prince charming?</p>
<p>Good looks can grant a job - good grief if you&rsquo;re a fraud</p>
<p>Even hollow words can fill the world with hope
Powerful enough to motivate change and growth</p>
<p>Growing up makes you wise or makes you weak
And makes you stubborn, makes you believe the promise
Of the lies that fuel prejudice</p>

<p>This is a slam I wrote last winter while reading Nisemonogatari and thinking about the impact of disinformation. It was mostly an automatic writing exercice but liked the result enough to share it. I still have a few more old texts to share over the next few weeks before I run out and publish newâ„¢ content to this blog.</p>
